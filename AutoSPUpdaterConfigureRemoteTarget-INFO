Get-WSManCredSSP confirmed my server was ready to accept credentials from a client:
The machine is not configured to allow delegating fresh credentials.
This computer is configured to receive credentials from a remote client computer


A computer policy does not allow the delegation of the user credentials to the target computer. 
Use gpedit.msc and look at the following policy: 
Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> System -> Credentials Delegation -> Allow Delegating Fresh Credentials. 
Verify that it is enabled and configured with an SPN appropriate for the target computer. 

In order to use CredSSP, you need to 
enable fresh credential delegation from your client, and 
enable receiving credentials on the server. 
In your instance, your remote computers will be your clients, 
and the system that holds the UNC share will be you server
